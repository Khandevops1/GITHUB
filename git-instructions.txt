IN GIT WE HAVE 3 STAGE:  1> WORKING STAGE - FILES THAT ARE NOT added
                         2> STAGING - AFTER WHEN WE RUN COMMAND "GIT ADD ." NOW FILES ARE STAGED
                         3> COMMIT - COMMITED (SAVED FILES)

FILES ALSO CAN 3 STATES: 1> INMODIFIED
                         2> MODIFIED
                         3> STAGED

WHEN WE RUN COMMAND GIT LOG WE SEE: 
                         1> COMMIT ID (COMMIT SHA/HASH)2
                         2> (HEAD -> master or main) - it means your branch that you work on, and last
                         3> AUTHOR - who made the commit 
                         4> DATE - when the commit was made 
                         5> COMMIT massage - what the commit is about 

git restore --staged "file name" - command for 
git log --oneline - command for 
git commit --amend - command to change the massage of the commit
